{"text": "Recent research on the early precursors of theory of mind have looked at innovative ways at capturing prelinguistic infants' understanding of other people's mental states, including perception and beliefs. Using a variety of experimental procedures, studies have shown that infants in their second year of life have an implicit understanding what other people see and what they know. A popular paradigm used to study infants' theory of mind is the violation of expectation procedure, which predicates on infants' tendency to look longer at unexpected and surprising events compared to familiar and expected events. Therefore, their looking times measures would give researchers an indication of what infants might be inferring, or their implicit understanding of events. One recent study using this paradigm found that 16-month-olds tend to attribute beliefs to a person whose visual perception was previously witnessed as being \"reliable\" compared to someone whose visual perception was \"unreliable\". Specifically, 16-month-olds were trained to expect a person's excited vocalization and gaze into a container to be associated with finding a toy in the reliable looker condition or an absence of a toy in the unreliable looker condition. Following this training phase, infants witnessed, in an object-search task, the same person either searching for a toy in the correct or incorrect location after they both witnessed the location of where the toy was hidden. Infants who experienced the reliable looker were surprised and therefore looked longer when the person searched for the toy in the incorrect location compared to the correct location. In contrast, the looking time for infants who experienced the unreliable looker did not differ for either search locations.

{"text": "A review of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the United States found that the prevalence of high frequency hearing loss, which can be noise-induced, among adolescent 12\u201319 years old increased significantly from 3.5% to 5.3% from 1994 until 2006, which equates to 1 in 20 children in the U.S. Although research is still limited, it suggests that increased exposure to loud noise through personal listening devices is a risk factor to this type of acquired hearing loss. The ubiquitous use of smartphones across the world is increasing at a rate \u201cfaster than our ability to assess their potential health consequences.\u201d Despite limited research, it is documented that 90% young adults across U.S. and European surveys have reported use of personal devices for several hours a day at maximum volume. At times, this sound level can be likened to a jet engine, exceeding 120 decibels. Recent research suggests stronger correlations found between extended duration and/or elevated usage of personal listening devices and hearing loss.", "title": "Noise-induced hearing loss", "page_id": "Noise-induced%20hearing%20loss", "synthesis": "Why do we lose hearing when we listen to music too loud?", "term_q": {"question": "What is it called when you hear loud noises?", "answer": "sensorineural hearing loss", "ae_score": null, "qg_score": null}, "random_q": {"question": "What percentage of young adults report using their devices for extended periods of time?", "answer": "90%", "ae_score": null, "qg_score": null}, "sec_id": "75--7---1---1--1"}

{"text": "Role ethics is an ethical theory based on family roles. Unlike virtue ethics, role ethics is not individualistic. Morality is derived from a person's relationship with their community. Confucian ethics is an example of role ethics. Confucian roles center around the concept of filial piety or ''xiao'', a respect for family members. According to Roger Ames and Henry Rosemont, \"Confucian normativity is defined by living one's family roles to maximum effect.\" Morality is determined through a person's fulfillment of a role, such as that of a parent or a child.
